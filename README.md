# VulkanRenderer

In this repository I will be making 2 renderers using the Vulkan API, one 3D and one 2D.  
  
While studying Game Development at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Kortrijk, Belgium, we made a DirectX renderer in our Graphics Programming class, this made me look into more APIs for rendering and landed on Vulkan to make my own Renderer with.  
This renderer will be integrated into my self made engines.  


As vulkan is not easy to start with without help, i used this tutorial to get me started:
