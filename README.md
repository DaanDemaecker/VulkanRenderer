# VulkanRenderer

## Intro
In this repository I will be making 2 renderers using the Vulkan API, one 3D and one 2D.  

As vulkan is not easy to start with without help, i used this tutorial to get me started:  
https://vulkan-tutorial.com
Later I also bought and used the official Vulkan programming guide from OpenGL for a deeper understanding.

## Motivation
While studying Game Development at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Kortrijk, Belgium, we made a DirectX renderer in our Graphics Programming class, this made me look into more APIs for rendering and landed on Vulkan to make my own Renderer with.  
This renderer is alsointegrated into my self made engine, as my engine project grew, this project became more of a testing ground for vulkan.  

## Goals
I wanted to deepen my understanding of graphics programming and in the long run build a small engine that i built myself from the ground up.  
I wanted to create a renderer completely on myself (with the help of tutorials but no starting project) as a challenge to see how far i could get.
