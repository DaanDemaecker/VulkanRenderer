# VulkanRenderer
This is a 3D renderer using the Vulcan API.  
  
While studying Game Development at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Kortrijk, Belgium, we made a DirectX renderer in our Graphics Programming class, this made me look into more APIs for rendering and landed on Vulkan to make my own Renderer with.  
This renderer will be integrated into my self made 3D engine.  


As vulkan is not easy to start with without help, i used this tutorial to get me started:
