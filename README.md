# VulkanRenderer

In this repository I will be making 2 renderers using the Vulkan API, one 3D and one 2D.  
  
While studying Game Development at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Kortrijk, Belgium, we made a DirectX renderer in our Graphics Programming class, this made me look into more APIs for rendering and landed on Vulkan to make my own Renderer with.  
This renderer is alsointegrated into my self made engine, as my engine project grew, this project became more of a testing ground for vulkan.  


As vulkan is not easy to start with without help, i used this tutorial to get me started:
